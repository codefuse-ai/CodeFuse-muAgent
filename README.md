## ü§ù Introduction
<p align="justify">
A brand new Agent Framework driven by LLM and EKG(Eventic Knowledge Graph,  Industry Knowledge Carrier)Ôºåcollaboratively utilizing MultiAgent, FunctionCall, CodeInterpreter, etc. Through canvas-based drag-and-drop and simple text writing, the large language model can assists you in executing various complex SOP under human guidance. It is compatbile with existing frameworks on the market and can achieve four core differentiating technical functions: Complex Reasoning, Online Collaboration, Human Interaction, Knowledge On-demand.
This framework has been validated in multiple complex DevOps scenarios within Ant Group. At the sametime, come and experience the Undercover game we quickly built!

## üöÄ QuickStart
For complete documentation, see: [CodeFuse-muAgent](https://codefuse.ai/docs/api-docs/MuAgent/overview/multi-agent)
For more [demos](https://codefuse.ai/docs/api-docs/MuAgent/connector/customed_examples)


### EKG Services

```bash
# use ekg services only four steps
# step1. git clone
git clone https://github.com/codefuse-ai/CodeFuse-muAgent.git

# step2. 
cd CodeFuse-muAgent

# step3. create docker-net
docker network create ekg-net

# step4. start all container services, it might cost some time
# after starting all services, open https://localhost:8000
docker-compose up -d
```

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34e5efea-f237-4b04-aeca-1f443ed7eb88

Now is beta version. Once the v1.0+ version is enhanced, we will release v1.0+ image for download.

To Be Continued!



### SDK 
We also provide a version of the SDK for using muagent.
1. Installation
```
pip install codefuse-muagent
```

2. Code answer Prepare related llm and embedding model configurations
you can see [docs](https://codefuse.ai/docs/api-docs/MuAgent/connector/customed_examples) and [~/examples](https://github.com/codefuse-ai/CodeFuse-muAgent/tree/main/examples)



## üß≠ Features
- **EKG Builder**ÔºöThrough the design of virtual teams, scene intentions, and semantic nodes, you can experience the differences between online and local documentation, or annotated versus unannotated code handover. For a vast amount of existing documents (text, diagrams, etc.), we support intelligent parsing, which is available for one-click import.
- **EKG Assets**ÔºöThrough comprehensive KG Schema design‚Äîincluding Intention Nodes, Workflow Nodes, Tool Nodes, and Character Nodes‚Äîwe can meet various SOP Automation requirements. The inclusion of Tool Nodes in the KG enhances the accuracy of tool selection and parameter filling. Additionally, the incorporation of Characters (whether human or agents) in the KG allows for human-involved process advancement, making it flexible for use in multiplayer text-based games.
- **EKG Reasoning**ÔºöCompared to purely model-based or entirely fix-flow Reasoning, our framework allows LLM to operate under human guidance-flexibility, control, and enabling exploration in unknown scenarios. Additionally, successful exploration experiences can be summarized and documented into KG, minimizing detours for similar issues.
- **Diagnose**ÔºöAfter KG editing, visual interface allows for quick debugging, and successful Execution path configurations will be automatically documented, which reduces model interactions, accelerates inference, and minimizes LLM Token costs. Additionally, during online execution, we provide comprehensive end-to-end visual monitoring.
- **Memory**ÔºöUnified message pooling design supports categorized message delivery and subscription based on the needs of different scenarios, like multi-agent. Additionally, through message retrievel, rerank and distillation, it facilitates long-context handling, improving the overall question-answer quality.
- **ActionSpace**ÔºöAdhering to Swagger protocol, we provide tool registration, tool categorization, and permission management, facilitating LLM Function Calling. We offer a secure and trustworthy code execution environment, and ensuring precise code generation to meet the demands of various scenarios, including visual plot, numerical calculations, and table editing.
